                  Renewable energy firms are mostly suffering a dire earnings season as struggling supply chains, manufacturing faults and rising production costs eat into profits. <br><br>With the world trying to transition at pace toward cleaner energy, equipment manufacturers are struggling to keep up with soaring global demand, leading to rising production costs and questions over the economic sustainability of large-scale projects from the industry’s major players. <br><br>Manufacturing faults, most notably at Siemens Energy’s wind turbine subsidiary Siemens Gamesa, have emerged as companies race to build turbines at a greater pace and scale.
                  The problems at Gamesa led Siemens Energy to scrap its profit forecast earlier this year, and last month the company sought guarantees of up to 15 billion euros ($16 billion) from the German government.
                  <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                    German newspaper Handelsblatt reported Monday that the German government will provide 7.5 billion euros in counter-guarantees, while banks involved in discussions will bear 12 billion euros to safeguard the company’s order book. <br><br>Specialist wind energy firms are also often finding themselves outbid for seabed licenses by traditional oil and gas players. Should they win a contract, electricity prices are often too low to justify the manufacturing costs, leaving companies looking to their governments in Europe and the U.S. to deliver greater subsidies and restore balance to the market. <br><br>As a result, most wind energy stocks are down sharply since the turn of the year.
                    In a report published last week, Allianz Research noted that the eight largest renewable energy firms in the world reported a combined total $3 billion decrease in assets in the first half of the year, with wind projects in particular facing turbulent conditions. The firm’s economists said the past earnings season was a “learning moment” for the industry.
                    “The whole sector is grappling with rising construction and financing costs, quality-control problems and supply-chain issues. Inflation and global energy-price fluctuations have also led to increased costs for wind-power projects, casting doubt over the feasibility of many ventures,” Allianz Research economists said. <br><br>“Some projects in the U.S. but also in the U.K. are at risk of being abandoned if governments do not offer support. As these projects were initiated before the energy crisis, with guaranteed feed-in-tariffs that were low, they are now becoming more and more unprofitable.”
                    Although balance sheets remain solid, renewables companies have been writing down assets and cutting their earnings outlooks. Danish company Ørsted announced last week that it was scrapping the development of two offshore projects in the U.S., with related impairments totaling $5.6 billion.
                    However, compatriot Vestas offered a ray of hope. The company posted a third-quarter EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) before special items of 70 million euros ($74.73 million), well above the 31 million euros projected in a company-compiled consensus. However, it also warned that external factors clouded its near-term outlook, pulling back its full-year investment and margin guidance.
                    <br><br>Its CEO Henrik Andersen told CNBC Wednesday that the sector was at an inflection point and that the market would eventually identify its “winners and losers” over time.
                    “We are very disciplined, we work with our customers and partners can rely on us, and governments can rely on us. That, I hope, creates the strong foundation for being one of the winners in the industry,” Andersen said.
                    “It’s not broken, but you can’t close your eyes and hope that any project you embark into discussions will always come through if the macroeconomic factors change.”

                  Sunnova Energy announced the expansion of its Global Command Center (GCC). The GCC, which has been operating for over a year, is now more powerful and efficient thanks to a number of enhancements, including the addition of new technologies, the expansion of its team of experts and improvements in operational efficiency.
                  <br /><br />
                  “Sunnova’s vision as a service-first company underscores our recognition of the critical importance of building a robust service infrastructure for the long term,” said William J. (John) Berger, CEO at Sunnova. “We understand that system services are paramount to ensuring our customers’ systems operate and the power flows as promised throughout the entirety of our 25-year relationship with them. The significant increase in the number of customers who have chosen to embrace solar energy in recent years highlights the paramount importance of not merely acquiring customers but consistently earning their trust and satisfaction. It is through our unwavering dedication to exceptional service that we achieve this

                    <br></br>The last UK individual to go into orbit was Tim Peake, who flew to the ISS as a European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut in 2015. <br><br>"This is an exciting opportunity and actually unique," he commented. <br><br>"No-one has done a 'national mission', commercially, like this before. It's a new model and would be paving the way for how we do space in the future."
                    Details are sparse at the moment. No crew has been chosen, nor is there a concept yet for how it would be selected. <br><br>And neither has the destination been fixed. <br><br>
                    Currently, all Axiom-organised missions have used capsules belonging to entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company to take participating astronauts to the ISS. 
                    <br /><br />
                    But the British mission could also be a free-flyer. That's to say, the crew would spend a number of days circling the Earth in just their capsule, conducting scientific experiments and performing outreach, before then returning to a splashdown on Earth. <br><br>Were the mission to visit the ISS, the US space agency (Nasa) would insist on certain conditions, one of which would be the inclusion in the crew of a seasoned astronaut. Very few UK passport-holders meet this criterion, with Tim Peake himself being an obvious candidate for commander.

                  <strong>Imagine you could go back in time 4.6 billion years and take a picture of our Sun just as it was being born. What would it look like?</strong> <br><br>Well, you can get a clue from this glorious new image acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). <br><br> Towards the centre of this object, called HH212, is a star coming into existence that is probably no more than 50,000 years old. <br><br>The scene would have looked much the same when our Sun was a similar age. <br><br>You can't actually see the glow from the protostar itself because it's hidden within a dense, spinning disc of gas and dust. <br><br>HH212 is sited in Orion, close to the three brilliant stars that make up the "belt" of the mythical hunter that gives the constellation its name. The distance from Earth is about 1,300 light-years. <br><br>Physics suggests those dramatic outflows of gas are the means by which the nascent star regulates its birthing.

                  ><span id="more3">
                    "As the blobby ball of gas at the centre compacts down, it rotates. But if it rotates too fast, it will fly apart, so something has to get rid of the angular momentum," explained Prof Mark McCaughrean. <br>
                    <img src="images/energy_img03.1.jpg" alt="" class="news_image" />
                    <br>"We think it's jets and outflows. We think that as all the material shrinks down, magnetic fields are pulled together and then some of the material coming in through the disc gets captured on magnetic fields and is thrown out through the poles. That's why we call these structures bi-polar," the European Space Agency senior scientific advisor told BBC News. <br><br>The pinky-red colour denotes the presence of molecular hydrogen. That's two hydrogen atoms bonded together (rather like the "HH" in the protostar's name). Shockwaves are moving through the outflows, energising them and making them glow brightly in this Webb picture, which was captured predominantly at the infrared wavelength of 2.12 microns (that's the second part of the protostar's name!).

                  The core–mantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremes—temperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br /><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneous—in particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet.

                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br><br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair. Using such small samples, it is a challenge to detect the precise <br><br>
                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called Mössbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use Mössbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements Mössbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scale—how it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

                  The core–mantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremes—temperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br /><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneous—in particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet.

                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br><br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair. Using such small samples, it is a challenge to detect the precise <br><br>
                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called Mössbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use Mössbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements Mössbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scale—how it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scale—how it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered."

"Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

                  The core–mantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremes—temperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br/><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneous—in particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet.

                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair.

                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called Mössbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use Mössbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements Mössbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure.
