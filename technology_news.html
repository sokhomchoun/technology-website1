                  Qualcomm has announced that it will officially unveil a new
                  chip that supports AI functionality for Microsoft Windows PCs,
                  and claims that it will be faster than Apple's chip. On
                  another Mac.
                  <br /><br />Qualcomm has said that the company's new
                  Snapdragon Elite X chip will be available on PCs from next
                  year, with a redesign to handle more AI tasks. Great for
                  summarizing emails, writing articles and creating images.
                  <br /><br />
                  Those AI features will also be a key part of Qualcomm's chips
                  for smartphones, as Google and Meta have both expressed
                  satisfaction and plans to use them.

                    At the same time, Microsoft called the new chip will help
                    businesses and consumers in the new era of AI PCs.
                    <br /><br />
                    According to Qualcomm on October 24, the new chip is faster
                    than the M2 Max in some functions and more powerful than
                    Apple and Intel chips.

                  <strong>Four UK astronauts could soon be heading into orbit on an all-British mission.</strong> <br><br>
                  An American company that organises visits to the International Space Station (ISS) is developing the plan.
                  <br /><br />Houston-based Axiom has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK Space Agency to try to make it happen.
                  <br /><br />
                  The project would probably cost Â£200m or more, but the idea is that it would be funded commercially. There would be no contribution from UK taxpayers.
                  <br><br>Axiom told the BBC that conversations with corporations and institutions interested in providing finance were already under way. <br></br>The last UK individual to go into orbit was Tim Peake, who flew to the ISS as a European Space Agency (Esa) astronaut in 2015. <br><br>"This is an exciting opportunity and actually unique," he commented. <br><br>"No-one has done a 'national mission', commercially, like this before. It's a new model and would be paving the way for how we do space in the future."

                    <img src="images/tech_img2.1.jpg" alt="" class="news_image" />
                    Details are sparse at the moment. No crew has been chosen, nor is there a concept yet for how it would be selected. <br><br>And neither has the destination been fixed. <br><br>
                    Currently, all Axiom-organised missions have used capsules belonging to entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company to take participating astronauts to the ISS. 
                    <br /><br />
                    But the British mission could also be a free-flyer. That's to say, the crew would spend a number of days circling the Earth in just their capsule, conducting scientific experiments and performing outreach, before then returning to a splashdown on Earth. <br><br>Were the mission to visit the ISS, the US space agency (Nasa) would insist on certain conditions, one of which would be the inclusion in the crew of a seasoned astronaut. Very few UK passport-holders meet this criterion, with Tim Peake himself being an obvious candidate for commander.
                    Axiom will soon begin attaching modules to the ISS that will eventually then uncouple as a separate architecture to form a commercial station when the veteran orbiting lab is decommissioned. <br><br> Much of the hardware for this enterprise is being manufactured in Italy at Thales Alenia Space, who built most of the habitable areas on the current space station. <br><br>The strong links between Axiom and Europe resulted this year in the company also signing a memorandum of understanding with Esa. <br><br>European member states see Axiom as a way to get more of their citizens into orbit, given the limited number of ISS flight opportunities that come directly to Esa by virtue of its membership of the space station project. <br><br>Hungary, Sweden, Poland and Italy are all pursuing the Axiom alternative. Although, unlike the proposed UK mission, these nations will use public money to finance the trips.
                    <br><br>"We are right now in a phase where we really have to prepare for the post-ISS period in low-Earth orbit; and this is a request also from our member states," said Daniel Neuenschwander, Esa's director of human and robotic exploration. <br><br>"You know that the commitment to the exploitation of the ISS has been extended by [European research ministers] until 2030.

What would it look like?</strong> <br><br>Well, you can get a clue from this glorious new image acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). <br><br> Towards the centre of this object, called HH212, is a star coming into existence that is probably no more than 50,000 years old. <br><br>The scene would have looked much the same when our Sun was a similar age. <br><br>You can't actually see the glow from the protostar itself because it's hidden within a dense, spinning disc of gas and dust. <br><br>HH212 is sited in Orion, close to the three brilliant stars that make up the "belt" of the mythical hunter that gives the constellation its name. The distance from Earth is about 1,300 light-years. <br><br>Physics suggests those dramatic outflows of gas are the means by which the nascent star regulates its birthing.

                    "As the blobby ball of gas at the centre compacts down, it rotates. But if it rotates too fast, it will fly apart, so something has to get rid of the angular momentum," explained Prof Mark McCaughrean. <br><br>"We think it's jets and outflows. We think that as all the material shrinks down, magnetic fields are pulled together and then some of the material coming in through the disc gets captured on magnetic fields and is thrown out through the poles. That's why we call these structures bi-polar," the European Space Agency senior scientific advisor told BBC News. <br><br>The pinky-red colour denotes the presence of molecular hydrogen. That's two hydrogen atoms bonded together (rather like the "HH" in the protostar's name). Shockwaves are moving through the outflows, energising them and making them glow brightly in this Webb picture, which was captured predominantly at the infrared wavelength of 2.12 microns (that's the second part of the protostar's name!).
                    The image of HH212 was acquired by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). You can't see the protostar itself because it's obscured by a dense, infalling disc of gas and dust. There are a few mature stars in the field of view, but most of the points of light are far-distant galaxies.</span>
                    In the annotated picture above, look closely at the left and right jets, and trace the knots of brightness in each of them. Count the bowshocks - where faster material has crashed into slower material just ahead of it. <br><br>The structures are remarkably symmetric... except there appears to be an additional, albeit very messy bowshock on the right. <br><br>In fact, there's probably a complementary bowshock on the other side. There are certainly pinky hints of it in a wider version of this Webb image. It's just that the density of gas and dust in space in that direction is thinner and so there's less material to excite and so the shock structure appears much more diffuse. <br><br>Astronomers have been studying HH212 for 30 years, taking pictures every now and then to see how it's changed. As you might expect from the Webb super telescope, its new view is 10 times sharper than anything we've had before and will enable scientists to delve deeper into the processes that drive star formation. <br><br>A nice feature is to run together the entire image history to make a movie, to see how elements in the jet structures change over time. Repeat observations mean you can also gauge the speed at which those elements are moving - at 100km per second and more. <br><br>
                    Media caption, <br><br>
                    Watch: See how the structure of HH212 has changed since being viewed in 2000 <br><br>
                    I've kind of suggested the HH stands for molecular hydrogen, and it's a neat fit. But it really stands for Herbig-Haro, after George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, who did the pioneering work on this type of object in the 1940s and 50s. <br><br>
                    They would no doubt be amazed by the capabilities of JWST. It's not just the sharpness of image that Webb can achieve with its 6.5m primary mirror, it's also the breadth of colour its instruments can now detect that makes the telescope so special. 
                    "As we said, the main wavelength for looking at these things - for looking at shocked molecular hydrogen - is 2.12 microns, or roughly four times longer than the mid-visible. But for the first time, we now have a good colour image of this particular object because we're able to observe it at other wavelengths that you just couldn't see from ground telescopes. And that will help us get into what's really happening in the jets," said Prof McCaughrean.
                    <br><br> Webb was intended to be transformative in many fields of astronomy, and the study of Herbig-Haro objects has definitely benefitted. <br><br>Look below and you can marvel at HH212's cousin, called HH211. This object, located in the Perseus constellation, is even younger, again measured in mere thousands of years. To think our Sun started out like this.

                  The coreâmantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremesâtemperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br /><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneousâin particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet. 
                  <span id="dots4">...</span
                  ><span id="more4">
                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br><br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair. Using such small samples, it is a challenge to detect the precise <br><br>
                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use MÃ¶ssbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scaleâhow it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

                  The coreâmantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremesâtemperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br /><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneousâin particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet.

                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br><br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair. Using such small samples, it is a challenge to detect the precise <br><br>
                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use MÃ¶ssbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scaleâhow it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

                  The coreâmantle boundary (CMB) is the interface between the Earth's iron metal core and the thick rocky layer of mantle just above the core. It is a world of extremesâtemperatures thousands of degrees Fahrenheit and pressures over a million times the pressure at the surface of the Earth. While it may seem far away from our environment on Earth's surface, plumes of material from the CMB can ascend upwards through the planet over tens of millions of years, influencing the chemistry, geologic structure, and plate tectonics of the surface world where we live.
                  <br /><br />Though scientists cannot travel to the center of the Earth to study the CMB, they can get clues about what lies beneath the planet's surface by measuring earthquakes. Seismic waves travel at different speeds depending on the material they are traveling through, allowing researchers to infer what lies deep below the surface using seismic signatures. This is analogous to how ultrasound uses waves of sound to image inside of the human body. <br><br>
                  Recent research shows that the base of Earth's mantle is actually complex and heterogeneousâin particular, there are mountain-like regions where seismic waves mysteriously slow down. These blobs, named ultralow velocity zones (ULVZs) and first discovered by Caltech's Don Helmberger, are dozens of kilometers thick and lie around 3,000 kilometers beneath our feet.

                    <br><br>"Because we can't simply go down to the CMB and take measurements, there are many open questions about a region that is so important to our planet's evolution," says Jennifer Jackson, the William E. Leonhard Professor of Mineral Physics. "Why do the ULVZs exist and what are they made of? What do they teach us about how the Earth evolved and what role the region plays in the dynamics of the Earth? Are the blobs solid or molten at the extreme conditions at the CMB?"  <br><br>
                    In 2010, Jackson and her team suggested that the blobs contain a higher iron oxide content than the mantle surrounding them. Solid iron oxide would slow down seismic waves, which could explain the low velocities measured passing through the blobs. But could iron oxide even be solid at the extreme temperatures and pressures of the CMB? <br><br>Now, a new study from Jackson's laboratory has made detailed measurements of the behavior of iron oxide under a range of temperatures and pressures similar to those at the CMB. The resulting so-called phase diagram shows that, contrary to previous theories, iron oxide remains solid even at very high temperatures. This represents the strongest evidence so far that solid iron-rich regions are a realistic explanation for ULVZs and may play a pivotal role in deep-seated plume generation. The findings motivate future work on solid iron-rich materials to better understand the Earth's deep interior.  <br><br>A paper describing the research appeared in the journal Nature Communications on November 13. <br><br>At the atomic level, solid iron oxide is composed of iron and oxygen atoms neatly arranged in orderly repeating patterns. As the solid begins to melt, the atoms lose their rigidly ordered structure and begin to move around fluidly. The new study, led by former Caltech graduate student Vasilije Dobrosavljevic (PhD '22), aimed to experimentally determine the temperatures and pressures at which this transition happens. <br><br>Reaching extreme temperatures and pressures in experiments has been possible for decades, but the experiments require tiny samples, smaller than the average width of a human hair. Using such small samples, it is a challenge to detect the precise <br><br>
                    temperature at which a material begins the transition from solid to liquid. For over a decade, Jackson and collaborators have been developing a technique to detect melting at high pressures. The new study utilizes this precise technique, called MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy, to observe the dynamical configuration of iron atoms. <br><br>"We use MÃ¶ssbauer to answer questions about the dynamic movement of iron atoms," Dobrosavljevic says. "Over a short timeframe of around 100 nanoseconds, we want to know: do they barely move, as in a solid, or do they move a lot, as in a liquid? Our new study complements MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy with an independent method, X-ray diffraction, that lets us observe the positions of all atoms in the sample." <br><br>
                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scaleâhow it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."

                    After dozens of experiments at a range of temperatures and pressures, the team discovered that at the pressure of Earth's CMB, iron oxide melts at hotter temperatures than previously estimated: over 4,000 Kelvins, equivalent to about 6,700 degrees Fahrenheit. <br><br> The study also yielded an unexpected result about so-called atomic defects in iron materials. <br><br>Researchers have known that, at sea-level pressure, every sample of iron oxide has tiny regularly spaced defects in its atomic structure. For every 100 oxygen atoms, there are only about 95 iron atoms, meaning that about five iron atoms are "missing." Researchers have debated how these atomic-level defects might impact the material on a larger scaleâhow it conducts electricity and heat, for example, or deforms under pressure, and so on. These parameters are critical for understanding planetary interiors, where heat flow and material deformation drive planetary dynamics. However, the behavior of defects at high pressures and temperatures, like those found at the CMB, was unknown until now. 
                    <br><br>Dobrosavljevic and his team found that at temperatures several hundred Kelvins lower than the point at which iron oxide melts, the tiny atomic defects start to shift around within the solid material, becoming "disordered." This could explain why previous experiments suggested that iron oxide was melting at lower temperatures: Those experiments were actually seeing shifts in the defects rather than the melting of the whole crystal structure. <br><br>"Before the solid crystal transitions to a liquid, we see that the defect structure undergoes a transition from ordered to disordered," he says. "Now we want to know what effect does this newly discovered transition have on the physical properties of iron-rich regions like the ULVZ? How do the defects affect the transport of heat, and what does it mean for the formation and generation of upwelling plumes that reach the surface? These questions will guide further research." <br><br>The paper is titled "Melting and defect transitions in FeO up to pressures of Earth's core-mantle boundary."
